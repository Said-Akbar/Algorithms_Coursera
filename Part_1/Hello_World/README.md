This is an optional programming practice to get started in Java.

If you have programming experience, but you are not familiar with Java, read through the book - part 1.1 and 1.2 - provided by the course authors here: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/11model/

I have intermediate level coding experience with Python and found their web page very helpful.
